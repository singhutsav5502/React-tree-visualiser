## Introduction

React TreeVis is a tool designed to help developers visualize the hierarchy of React components within a single file, enabling a better understanding of complex JSX structures.

  

## Features

-  **Visualization of JSX Components**: Upload a `.js` or `.jsx` file to see its components displayed in a tree-like structure.

-  **Interactive Visualization**: Use React Flow to interact with the components, move them around, and gain a better understanding of the component hierarchy.

-  **Customization**: Differentiate between React components and HTML tags through visual cues.
